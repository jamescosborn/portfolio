# James Osborn's Portfolio

#### Made at the end of the 1st week at Epicodus, 09/08/17

#### _**By James Osborn**_

## Description

_In this portfolio, you will find information on the 2017-18 Epicodus Intro to C# student 'James Carl Osborn.' The contents of James Osborn's Portfolio on GitHub Pages should all be functional and fairly straightforward. The works of this portfolio are by no means complete, with many new projects expected to be added in the weeks to come._

_There are 3 pages currently located in the Profile: 'Index' (Home), 'About Me', and 'Project Links'. 'Index' contains 3 quotes from 3 of James' favorite people in life. 'About Me' contains James' background and work history, a photo of his online Steam 'avatar', and a list of some of his skills and hobbies. Finally, 'Project Links' contains 5 different links to projects James has worked on during his first week at Epicodus, as well as a link to the website for 'Hawken,' a free-to-play multiplayer video game James worked on for 2 years. Is it strange that James is writing in the 3rd person? James doesn't mind._
