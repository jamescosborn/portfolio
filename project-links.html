      <p> Hey there! Thanks for checking out some of the projects I've been working on. It's only been 3 days, but I feel like I'm learning a lot already. If you have any suggestions on how I could improve my work, please email me (<a href="mailto:jamescarlosborn@gmail.com?subject=Feedback">jamescarlosborn@gmail.com</a>). I always appreciate feedback and constructive criticism. I've got a long way to go, but I feel like I've already come a long way. Oh, and I love cheese.</p>
