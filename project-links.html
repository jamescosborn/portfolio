      <p> Hey there! Thanks for checking out some of the projects I've been working on. It's only been 3 days since I started learning HTML, but I feel like I'm learning a lot already. If you have any suggestions on how I could improve my work, please email me at <a href="mailto:jamescarlosborn@gmail.com?subject=Feedback">jamescarlosborn@gmail.com</a>. I always appreciate feedback and constructive criticism. I've got a long way to go, but I feel like I've already come a long way. Oh, and I love cheese.</p>

          <p>This is the very first project that I worked on. It's not much to look at, just some basic HTML.</p>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/jamescosborn/hello-world">Hello World</li></a>
          <p>Same as above, uses only HTML.</p>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/jamescosborn/goodbye-world">Goodbye World</li></a>
          <p>Same as above, uses only HTML.</p>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/jamescosborn/resort">Alcatraz Resort: Prison or Paradise?</li></a>
          <p>Here's where things get interesting. This is one of the best projects I've worked on so far. It uses a few CSS rules, and includes a README (written in Markdown language).</p>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/jamescosborn/travel-project">Tokyo Travel Brochure</li></a>
          <p>There was a more recent commit of this project that unfortunately wasn't pushed to GitHub. This project uses HTML, CSS, and it's my first foray in to Bootstrap.</p>

          <p class="important">Here is a game that I worked on for 2 years. I'm very proud of it. I used Excel to write test plans, Outlook to send testing instructions and plans to other QA testers, and UnrealProp to deliver daily game builds. I also made a prototype "white box" map called <em>'Night City'</em> with Unreal Engine 3.</p>
